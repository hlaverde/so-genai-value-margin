-- Stack Overflow question-level validation pool for AI-answerability audit.
-- Run in Stack Exchange Data Explorer against Stack Overflow.
-- Save as: data/raw/stackoverflow/stackoverflow_question_validation_pool.csv
--
-- Rationale:
--   The project AI-answerability index is built outside SEDE. This query exports
--   a deterministic pre-ChatGPT question pool from top pre-period tags. Python
--   then joins tag-level AI-answerability and draws high/mid/low strata.
--
-- Notes:
--   - p.Id % 100 is a deterministic low-cost sampling rule.
--   - Increase/decrease the modulo if the result is too small/large.
--   - Body is required for human/LLM coding; do not manually edit exports.
