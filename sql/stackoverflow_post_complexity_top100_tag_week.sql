-- Stack Overflow tag-week post-complexity extract for the top 100 pre-ChatGPT tags.
-- This aggregated version avoids exporting millions of post-level rows from SEDE.
-- Export as: stackoverflow_post_complexity_tag_week.csv
-- Simplified to avoid SEDE internal errors from correlated row-level expressions.
